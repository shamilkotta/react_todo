### since lint-staged covers all the prettier and lint chcking we don't need explicit format check
# npm run format:check ||
# (
#   echo "❗❗Prettier check failed😥, Run npm run format, add changes and commit again❗❗"
#   false;
# )

npx lint-staged ||
(
  echo '🟥🟥eslint check failed😥, try npm run lint:fix or fix it manualy, add changes and commit again🟥🟥'
  false;
)

# npm run build ||
# (
#   echo "🟥🟥 Oh s**, build faild, View the errors above to see why🟥🟥"
